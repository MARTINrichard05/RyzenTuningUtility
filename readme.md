## about
A little program that allow you to easily tune your Ryzen's settings.    
You can use it even if you don't really know what you are doing there is not that much of a risk of damaging the cpu because i d'ont allow to modify critical settings

It is not made to overclock the cpu or anything like that, just to change some common setting to get desired performance and noise (fan)
